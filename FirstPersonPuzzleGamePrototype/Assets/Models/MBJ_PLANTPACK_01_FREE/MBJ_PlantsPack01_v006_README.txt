Thank you for downloading the free version of plants asset pack 1! :)

Eventually there will be a .pdf file that includes images/guides but for now, I am afraid you'll just have to bear with me.

This pack was meant for Blender only but I thought I might as well export stuff in .fbx for other people to use too. 
But just know that I won't be able to support you in getting the assets to look how they do in the screenshots using other programs.


_____________Using The Blender Render File____________________________

If you just want to use them for renders inside Blender and not for game engines or another suite, then you don't have to worry about anything, you can pretty much just move stuff around to where you want and then press f12 to make use of my render settings.




_____________Using The Blender Export File____________________________

Since v003, there is now only one scene and the only thing you have to do is "zero out" the origin for your plant+pot after you customise it to your liking. 

To "zero out" origin, select your plant + plant pot (after having positioned them to be together), press CTRL + J to join them, then press SHIFT + C which puts your cursor at 0,0 the middle of scene, 
then go to OBJECT > Origin to cursor, then OBJECT > Geometry to origin (at this point your plant+pot should be in the middle of the screen) proceed to move them up along the Z axis, so that the bottom of the plant pot is at the origin point
and then, press CTRL + A and apply location and then CTRL + A again to apply rotation and scale. 

You're done! Now all you have to do is FILE > EXPORT > Choose your format and make sure to tick EXPORT SELECTED in the bottome left panel. 

Unfortunately the .fbx doesn't retain my material settings but it should be relatively easy to recreate in other programs but as previously stated, I won't be able to help much. 

The main thing to consider is to keep flat shading, bump up the AO, have the material give a slight emission and very low specular and have a blueish environment light/mist. There are a few more things but if you have any questions you can message me on twitter @madebyjawns or email madebyjawns@gmail.com


_____________Using The Unity Package_________________________________


Start a new project, right click in your project folder tab and go to Import Package > Custom Package and find "MadeByJawns_PlantPack01_v006.unitypackage" then double click on the Demo scene level and it should be all setup for you. As stated by the overlay text in the scene, if the lighting looks off, please go to Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings and change the Colour Space to Linear. This should get your scene looking exactly like the included screenshot of of own Unity file.
